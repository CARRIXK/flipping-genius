# Flipping Genius

## About the Game

Flipping Genius is a web-based card memory game where players flip cards to find matching pairs. The game tests memory and concentration, with a clean and interactive design. The goal is to match all pairs as quickly as possible using the fewest moves.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using the following technologies:

- HTML – Structuring the game elements
- CSS – Styling and animations
- JavaScript – Game logic and interactivity
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)  – Responsive design and layout
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/kits/1110908b34/setup?created=yes&hosting=hosted) – Icons for UI enhancements
- CSS-Pattern.com - Used for the back style of the cards
- RealFaviconGenerator - Create a favicon file

## Development Team

Flipping Genius is a collaborative effort developed by:

- David Coles
- Carrick Entwistle
- Nils Olov Lugner
- Josh Williams

## Project Methodology

We have followed Agile planning methodologies, breaking down the development process into user stories, sprints, and iterative improvements. This approach has allowed for effective team collaboration and continuous enhancement of the game.

## How to Play


1. Choose the dificullty you will like to play.
2. Select from the options the card types you want and start game
3. Click on a card to flip it over.

# Testing/validation

## Lighthouse automated testing:** 

Google Lighthouse to assess the site's performance, accessibility, and SEO. By conducting audits for both mobile and desktop views, Key performance metrics such as Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and First Contentful Paint (FCP) were identified. Necessary code adjustments were then made to enhance scores, resulting in a faster, more accessible, and SEO-optimized website.

## Manual Testing: 

Throughout development, manual testing was conducted to verify the website's functionality and responsiveness. Each section was evaluated across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices to ensure the layout adapted correctly and maintained a user-friendly experience. Additionally, CSS animations and sound effects underwent rigorous testing to ensure consistency and performance. These efforts helped deliver a seamless user experience and optimal site functionality.

## Credits

[GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com) was used to create the game's logo, accelerate development, and assist with debugging.


## Future Enhancements

- It is hard to see the game cards when the game is on highest dificulty as. This will need to be addressed in future iterations to improve UX.
- Add more card category images
- Add more images for the back of the cards
