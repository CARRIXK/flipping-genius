# Flipping Genius

## About the Game

Flipping Genius is a web-based card memory game where players flip cards to find matching pairs. The game tests memory and concentration, with a clean and interactive design. The goal is to match all pairs as quickly as possible using the fewest moves.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using the following technologies:

- HTML – Structuring the game elements
- CSS – Styling and animations
- JavaScript – Game logic and interactivity
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)  – Responsive design and layout
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)  – Custom typography
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/kits/1110908b34/setup?created=yes&hosting=hosted) – Icons for UI enhancements
- CSS-Pattern.com - Used for the back style of the cards
- RealFaviconGenerator - Create a favicon file

## Development Team

Flipping Genius is a collaborative effort developed by:

- David Coles
- Carrick Entwistle
- Nils Olov Lugner
- Josh Williams

## Project Methodology

We have followed Agile planning methodologies, breaking down the development process into user stories, sprints, and iterative improvements. This approach has allowed for effective team collaboration and continuous enhancement of the game.

## How to Play


1. Choose the dificullty you will like to play.
2. Select from the options the card types you want and start game
3. Click on a card to flip it over.
4. Try to find the matching card by flipping another card.
5. If the cards match, they remain flipped over.
6. If the cards do not match, they are flipped back over.

# Testing/validation

## Lighthouse automated testing:** 

Google Lighthouse to assess the site's performance, accessibility, and SEO. By conducting audits for both mobile and desktop views, Key performance metrics such as Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and First Contentful Paint (FCP) were identified. Necessary code adjustments were then made to enhance scores, resulting in a faster, more accessible, and SEO-optimized website.

## Manual Testing: 

Manual tests were conducted to ensure the functionality and responsiveness of the website. Each link was manually tested to confirm that it redirected to the correct destination. All sections were checked for responsiveness across different devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile) to ensure that the layout adjusted properly and remained user-friendly. Additionally, hover effects were tested by interacting with various elements like buttons and navigation items to verify that the visual changes (bold text) worked consistently. These tests helped ensure a seamless user experience and proper functionality across the site.

## Validator Testing

* **HTML** : No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C Markup validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options)

* **CSS** : No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
 


## Deployment

The site has been set up using GitHub Pages and can be accessed here [https://carrixk.github.io/flipping-genius/](https://carrixk.github.io/flipping-genius/)

Deployment steps:

**Deployment Steps:**
   - Push all project files to the main branch of the GitHub repository.
   - Go to the repository settings.
   - Navigate to the "Pages" section.
   - Under "Source," select the branch (e.g., `main`) and folder (e.g., `/root`) where the site files are located.
   - Save the settings. GitHub then automatically built and deployed the site.


## Credits

[GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com) was used to generate the games logo. It was also used to accelerate development. 


## Future Enhancements

- It is hard to see the game cards when the game is on highest dificulty as. This will need to be addressed in future iterations to improve UX.
- Add more card category images
